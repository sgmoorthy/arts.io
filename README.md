# Gallery.io
A Python Django-powered web application for artists and designers to showcase their artwork.

## Try it Out
If you'd like to try Gallery.io out for yourself, since I haven't deployed it yet
(and may never), follow these instructions.  
**Note:** you need Python and Django installed.

1. Download or clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/zach-king/Gallery.io.git
```

2. Change into the application directory
```
cd Gallery.io/gallery/
```

3. Start the server
```
python manage.py runserver
```
